        <h1>Types of food</h1>
        <p>Food is the basic need for all living beings to exist.We have seven types of food in the world</p>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Carbohydrate</h2>
            <p>Carbohydrate are sugare molecules. One of the main nutrients found with foods and drinks</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rice</li>
                <li>Garri</li>
                    <li>Bread</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Protein</h2>
            <p>Proteins are large biomolecules and macromolecules that comprise one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells and organisms</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Meat</li>
                <li>Beans</li>
                    <li>Turkey</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Fats</h2>
            <p>All foods containing fat have a mix of specific types of fats. Even healthy foods like chicken and nuts have small amounts of saturated fat, though much less than the amounts found in beef, cheese, and ice cream.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                    <li>Cheese</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Minerals</h2>
            <p>Minerals are foods like cereals,bread,meat,fish,vegetable.Minerals are essential nutrients that your body needs to function properly. They are divided into two categories: macrominerals and trace minerals. Macrominerals are needed in larger amounts and include calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, and sulfur. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Meat</li>
                <li>Vegetables</li>
                    <li>Turkey</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Vitamins</h2>
            <p>Vitamins are organic molecules (or a set of closely related molecules called vitamers) that are essential to an organism in small quantities for proper metabolic function. Essential nutrients cannot be synthesized in the organism in sufficient quantities for survival, and therefore must be obtained through the diet. </p>
        </section>
        <ul>
            <li>Fish</li>
            <li>Pork</li>
                <li>Brocolli</li>
        </ul>
        <section>
            <h2>Water</h2>
            <p>Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2O. It is a transparent, tasteless, odorless,[c] and nearly colorless chemical substance, and it is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent[19]). It is vital for all known forms of life, despite not providing food energy or organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds.</p>
